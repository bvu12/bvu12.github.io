I am a **second-degree student** studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
I love learning about and crafting elegant solutions to complex problems, collaborating in cross-functional teams, and seeing my work have a real-world impact.

In my present role as a Software Engineering Co-op Student, I actively contribute to both the backend and frontend of our tech stack, transforming business and product **ideas into engineering solutions**. 

My first degree was in Mechanical Engineering, and prior to my switch to the software industry I was putting out fires working as a management consultant.
I'm happy to be **back to my technical roots** and am eager to continue growing and learning each day.

Outside of work and school, I'm an avid foodie, I keep active through weightlifting and cycling, and I'm patiently waiting for Elder Scrolls VI to release.
