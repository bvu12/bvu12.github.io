A webgame where the user guesses which article of designer clothing is more expensive.\nLearning objectives # I set off on developing this project to meet a few goals:\nChallenge myself to complete and deploy a project end-to-end by myself Learn how to use Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS Learn how to take feedback on my own work to make it better Technologies used # Technology Description MongoDB a NoSQL database used to store our products Next.js a React framework used to develop the frontend + backend and used to deploy the application Tailwind CSS a CSS framework used to style the frontend TypeScript a superset of JavaScript that adds static types How does it work # Backend # On page load, a few products are randomly fetched from our MongoDB database into a list. To improve performance, subsequent products are periodically fetched in the background as the user gets more correct answers.\nFrontend # Two cards are initially displayed side-by-side on the screen, when the user correctly selects the more expensive product we increment the state of a counter variable. This setState operation slides down along our product array and re-renders the next product. When you incorrectly select a product, the Gameover screen shows and places all products[0...n] into a carousel.\nWe have the ability to restart the game over again by calling our startGame function:\nconst startGame = (productAPISuffix: string) =\u0026gt; { setIsLoading(true); fetchProducts(productAPISuffix).then(() =\u0026gt; { setGameType(productAPISuffix); setScore((prevScore) =\u0026gt; ({ currentScore: 0, hiScore: prevScore.hiScore, })); setIsGameOver(false); setIsLoading(false); }); }; ","date":"25 June 2023","permalink":"/projects/ssense/","section":"projects","summary":"Check out the code on Github or play the game for yourself here!","title":"Higher or Lower?"},{"content":"Hello there!
